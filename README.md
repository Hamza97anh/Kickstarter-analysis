# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns. 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In the Kickstarter Excel sheets. We find  a collection of data gathered from various kickstart fundraisers outlining key data sets that help determine what makes a successful kickstarter campaign. In this Reposstory. You will find a collection of charts extrapulated from the Kickstarter sheets to help outline key factors that display what makes a good Kickstarter campaign. 
### Purpose
Louise's play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. By using data from the Kickstarter sheets. I display a series of charts that show the outcome of plays in relation to the launch date and a chart the displays the outcome of plays in relations to their respective goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
In the intial stages. We first sifted through the data and made it more organized by color coding some colums to make them easier to visualize. We took some data that was harder to read and converted to a format that was easy to comprehend such as dates. We divided the types of events to Parent Catagories and Subcatagories to make it easier to filter out our desired data. 
For the Outomes Based on Launch Date we created a new column for year using code "=Year()". This was necassary for out next step where we creat a pivot table to that we can then use to make a chart. The "Years" Column is used to add filters if needed for our chart. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
